This integrated system is critical in protecting and improving the well-being of people living in barangays. The proposed project aims to create a program for the effective management of the barangay health unit that will improve system efficiency by ensuring effective monitoring of services and activities, enhancing transparency and accountability by providing patients, barangay health workers, and administrators with access to:
